    <h2>About Me</h2>

    <p>
    
    
    
    I am a Lambda student enrolled in the Fullstack Web Development immersive due to start February 25 2019.
    This website was created utilizing tutorials and my foundational skills learned from 
    the Introduction to Web Development Course. My goal for this website is to continue to apply the 
    skills learned during the course to this website and keep track of my growth on GitHub. 
    The most impressive thing I have built is a home for a family, as a volunteer for Habitat for Humanity.
    There is a sense of satisfaction and a feeling of accomplishment from seeing the finished product. 
    That is the  same feeling I get when my code works.
    In both cases after a build a footprint is left behind.
