    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
    
        The most impressive thing I have built is a home for a family, as a volunteer for Habitat for Humanity.
    There is a sens of satisfaction and feeling of accomplishment from seeing the finished product. The same feeling I get when 
    writing  an efficient block of code. A legacy and a footprint are left behind.
    
    I am currently enrolled in an immersive at Lambda that is to start in three weeks.
    This website was created utilizing tutorials and my foundational skills learned from the Introduction to Web Development Course.
    I can't wait to see what I accomplish during the immersive.
